## NOTES
* In this assignment, I felt like I'm getting more familiar with HTML elements, and how to connect them with CSS. For example, formatting buttons based on a id;

* To build the JS logic, I used `let countNum` to store the number of user's clicks; then using `querySelector` to collect the data from the html script;

* Playing around with d3 I learned how to import the module by using <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>. It's also possible to download the package and upload it through the path directory, but using it online was easier for me;

* I couldn'd build anything useful with d3, but I was able to explore the patterns of the library at https://d3js.org/. I also explored: 
> * select, and selectAll in the console,
> * getting familiar with .data(), .enter(), .append(), .text().

<!-- 
// const container = d3.select('.countBtn')
//     .selectAll('button')
//     .data(countNum)
//     .enter()
//     .append('p')
//     .text(dta => dta) -->
