## NOTES

* The table was pretty straightforward to build. It was build based on the head data (th) and table data (td) from each table row (tr);
* Building an SVG image was hard. After spending a lot of time in a trial and error method, I had to take a step back and plan what exacty what I wanted to create:
> * I tried to create a rown of table, adding some social media images to it - ilustrating the table head. I added some strokes to path, but I couldn't find a way to add images inside each stroke.
      <!-- vertical lines
         <path stroke="white" d="M25 0 V100" />
         <path stroke="white" d="M50 0 V100" />
         <path stroke="white" d="M75 0 V100" /> -->
> * I ended up adding a single image to the SVG image.
* I struggled while designing the page: how can I combine the elements? Which one should be placed first, the table or the rectangle?
