## NOTES

### Margins
At first, it was challenging to think what is a margin. The greater the numbers, the smallest the chart, which was contra-intuitive for me Then, I understand that the margins are not the chart measurements, but the object in the middle of it Setting up a marging means defining the space which does not contain a chart It is where we don't have a chart that's the reason why it's easier to define the width and the height by subtracting the left and right margin, and the top and botton, in this order

### Functions
I'm still figuring out a way to work more productively with JS, and it's my first time working with functions. Organizing the ideas using functions make things a lot of easiers.
